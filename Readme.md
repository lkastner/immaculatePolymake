# Immaculate line bundles on toric varieties - an Extension for polymake

## Purpose
This extension for [polymake] (https://www.polymake.org) was devloped alongside
the article [Immaculate line bundles on toric varieties - authors below]
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09312). It can determine whether the whole
cohomology of a line bundle on a toric variety is trivial (we call such a line
bundle ``immaculate'') in a purely combinatorial manner.



## Usage
First clone the git into a directory. Then open polymake and
```
import_extension("/path/to/git/folder");
```
For examples how to compute things with this extension, please have a look at the `scripts` folder.
